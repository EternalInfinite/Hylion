 Alex failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so Alex made a fake report card. Alex did this every quarter that year. Alex forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and his mom got it before he could intercept with his fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already thrown out his records, so they had to take Alex's mother’s “proof” (the fake ones he made throughout the year) and “correct” the “mistake.” Alex has never told her the truth.
